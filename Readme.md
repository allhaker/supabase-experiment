# Supabase Experiment

# README IS IN PROGRESS, MORE WILL COME

### Technologies Used

- **React**
- **Supabase**: An open-source Firebase alternative for building secure and scalable applications.
- **Supabase Serverless**: Serverless functions provided by Supabase for backend logic.
- **Node.js**
- **Postgres**

### Run Frontend
To run the frontend of the project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. **Start the Development Server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

3. **Open Your Browser**:
    Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine before running these commands.

You should be able to run Frontend out of the box. I used Supabase for the backend. Everything is deployed and all the credentials are baked in, which is something I'd never do for any real production app.
